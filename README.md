This repository features an informal study on the Stable Diffusion image generator. The best
way to view it and interact with it is to clone the repository locally, and open the file
`index.html` with a web browser.

However, for convenience, one can simply use
[htmlpreview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sd-study/sd-study/blob/main/index.html)
to go through the explanations and the images, which should still be usable.
